# Five Nights at Deadline
Five Nights at Deadline is a game where you are a college student down to your last luck with the deadline of your task, and your sanity is clearly declining. Survive the night by finishing your lab report, but be careful of your sanity; the more it reduces, the more "insane" you become, and the more crazy you are. Suddenly you see monsters appearing trying to take you down by making you pass out and fall asleep. To prevent this, you need to keep your sanity up by doom scrolling and using the flashlight if you see the monster nearby, but be careful, your phone battery is low, and if it runs out, you will not make it out alive and get 0 by your lab. Avoid this by managing everything carefully and making sure you finish your work. Good luck, engineering student; this will become your daily in semester 3.
